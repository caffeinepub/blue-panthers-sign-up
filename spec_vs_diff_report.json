  "summary": "All four requirements are substantially implemented. REQ-1 adds getAllSignUps in backend/main.mo. REQ-2 adds useGetAllSignUps in useQueries.ts. REQ-3 creates OwnerDashboard.tsx with auth gating, table, loading states, empty state, and navy/gold styling. REQ-4 adds a /owner route in App.tsx and a subtle footer link in Layout.tsx. One concern: the backend getAllSignUps requires admin permission via AccessControl rather than being a simple public query. Additionally, useActor.ts was modified despite being listed as a protected file in constraints.",
