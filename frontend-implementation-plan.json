Modify the slot availability calculation so that Guard displays '1 Slot Open' (singular) when 0 players have signed up and 'Full' when 1 player has signed up. Keep Forward and Center using max capacity of 2, displaying '2 Slots Open' or 'Full' as before. The component currently uses a hardcoded max of 2 for all positions; add position-specific capacity logic."
